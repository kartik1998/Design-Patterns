## 10 Important Design Patterns

| Pattern                 | Category   | Description & Use Case                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Singleton               | Creational | Ensures a class has only one instance; used for global state or shared resources.    |
| Factory Method          | Creational | Delegates instantiation to subclasses; decouples object creation from usage.         |
| Abstract Factory        | Creational | Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.             |
| Builder                 | Creational | Constructs complex objects step by step; separates construction from representation. |
| Prototype               | Creational | Clones existing objects; useful for costly or complex object creation.               |
| Adapter                 | Structural | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.                                     |
| Decorator               | Structural | Dynamically adds new behavior to objects.                                            |
| Facade                  | Structural | Simplifies complex subsystems with a unified interface.                              |
| Proxy                   | Structural | Controls access, adds security, or lazy-loads resources.                             |
| Strategy                | Behavioral | Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms or behaviors.                                |
| Observer                | Behavioral | Enables event-driven, one-to-many notifications.                                     |
| State                   | Behavioral | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.              |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Passes requests along a chain of handlers; decouples sender and receiver logic.      |
