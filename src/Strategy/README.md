## Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows a class's behavior to be selected at runtime.

### Real World analogy
Think of a navigation app (like Google Maps). You can choose different strategies for reaching a destination: driving, walking, or biking. The app calculates the route based on the chosen strategy.
