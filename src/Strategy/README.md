## Strategy Design Pattern

A Strategy Pattern says that "defines a family of functionality, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable".

Benefits:

- It provides a substitute to subclassing.
- It defines each behavior within its own class, eliminating the need for conditional statements.
- It makes it easier to extend and incorporate new behavior without changing the application.
- When the multiple classes differ only in their behaviors.e.g. Servlet API.
- It is used when you need different variations of an algorithm.
